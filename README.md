# vimrc
## Features
  * Tab autocompletion instead of ^N ^P
  * Relative line numbers
  * Windows tabulation by default, even if one window only.
  * Apparently also has F7 to pdflatex macro
  * Tabs are 2 literal spaces. 
  * Supports Verilog syntax for certain file endings but this is certainly worthless.
  
## Caveats
Would likely need to configure stuff per box (e.g. background and tab colors).
